# Type Master Pre-Launch Page
## Description
---------------
This project serves as a static pre-launch landing page for a web application. The project was completed using only HTML and CSS and deployed with github pages. Page layout was implemented with flexbox, although grid was also an option.

Currently, there are no links attached to the buttons so clicking on the buttons has no effect. This can be achived at a later stage with the html anchor tag or with JavaScript.
## Features
------------
- Optimal layout depending on device's screen size.
- Hover states for interactive elements (mainly buttons).
