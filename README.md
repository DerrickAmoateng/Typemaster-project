# Type Master Pre-Launch Page
## Description
---------------
This project serves as a static pre-launch landing page for a web application. The project was completed using only HTML and CSS and deployed with github pages. Page layout was implemented  mostly with css position property and some minor organization of elements using flexbox and grid display.

Currently, there are no links attached to the buttons so clicking on the buttons has no effect. This can be achived at a later stage with the html anchor tag or with JavaScript.

The mobile view feature accomodates screens with a maximum width of 375px whiles the tablet view feature applies to screens with width between 376px and 768px.

The page renders an optimal layout for desktop scrrens not exceeding 1440px.
## Features
